Despite being in poor health and constantly sleep-deprived, Layla has performed excellently in the eyes of her teachers and peers; however, this is not apparent from her numerous lamentations about her studies. Instead, she attributes her success to her sleepwalking and having \"The Stars' Blessing.\"",
